        <h1>Albums</h1>
        <p>J cole released 6 albums. 2010-2013 "Friday Night Lights, Born sinner and Cole World: The Sideline Story", 2014 "2014 Forest Hills Drive", finally 2016 "4 you eyez only and K.O.D. Each have high sales, the highest would be K.O.D. currently, and of course the more it sell would mean how good it is. Thats what some think of course.
            
            Not many relize the pattern that J Cole is laying out when he drops an album. Some albums he pour Jermaine out, others he shows us J Cole.
